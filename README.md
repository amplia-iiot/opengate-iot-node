# OpenGate IOT Node

Node-RED node to send IOT data to our [OpenGate](https://www.amplia-iiot.com/iot-platform/) IOT platform.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

This software must be installed to deploy and run the OpenGate IOT node:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
- [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/local)

### Deploying OpenGate IOT node

To deploy the OpenGate IOT node in your Node-RED server

```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fjdearcos-amplia/opengate-iot-node <opengate-iot-node-location>
# Move to your node-red location (usually $USER/.node-red)
cd <node-red-location>
# Install OpenGate IOT node
npm install <opengate-iot-node-location>
```

The build includes two ODA assemblies to make some test with our software using MQTT and CoAP protocols. The assemblies can be found inside *oda-demos* folder.
